    <h2 class='head'>DETAILS</h2>

    <p>The basic elements of storytelling are timeless, but every new shift in technology changes the way we create, convey and keep our stories. Digital tools have opened up an entire world of potential for storytelling, but we’re still in the very early days of this new cutlural moment.</p>
    <p>To make the most of an emerging form for an ages-old practice, we’re pulling together others who see the potential and want to explore this new land in the first Digital Storytelling Unconference for the greater Vancouver area. For a full summer day at the Network Hub, located in New Westminster’s historic and scenic River Market, attendees will share experiences, ideas and experiments in using digital tools to tell both new and old stories.</p>
    <p>As an unconference, all attendees are welcome to pitch sessions at the start of day, which will be given rooms and times to present based on interest. There are no keynote speakers, no pre-arranged timeslots, and everything that happens will be bigger than the sum of its parts.</p>
    <p>Who’s coming? Technologists, publishers, branders, historians, and anyone else who recognizes the importance of storytelling and realizes the potential of digital tools to do so in new and innovative ways.</p>
    <p>Join us for what will be an amazing one-day experience in one of the Lower Mainland’s most beautiful and accessible spots. We don’t know what you’ll learn, but we know you’ll leave with a good story to tell.</p>

    <h2 class='head'>the venue - the network hub</h2>

    <p>Offering affordable coworking space, The Network Hub gives startups a starting point and freelancers a place to work that isn’t home or the local cafe. Professionally staffed with a spacious, modern design and state of the art facilities, we cannot think of a better spot or more gracious hosts for the first Digital Storytelling Unconference, and couldn’t ask for a warmer welcome from our title sponsors.</p>
    <p>For meetings, a private office or shared hotdesk as well as virtual office services, look at what the Network Hub offers and just try to find a better price or more friendly people.</p>

    <h2 class='head'>the river market</h2>

    <p>In the heart of New Westminster a well-kept secret is quickly becoming a rejuvenated public centre. The River Market is at the centre of that change, set against the shore of the Fraser River and winding rail lines. A  strong sense of industrial history and optimisim can be felt throughout.</p>

    <h2 class='head'>FAQ</h2>

    <p><strong>What does the ticket price cover?</strong><br />
    Admission and a package lunch from one of several great vendors in the Market. We will also have tea, coffee and water on hand in the event space. We’ll have more details on participating vendors closer to the day of the event.</p>

    <p><strong>Outside of Vancouver? I’m scared!</strong><br />
    Don’t be, it’s way easier than you think. If you’re coming from Vancouver your best bet is to leave your car at home and take the Skytrain Expo line to the New Westminster station. The River Market is just a 5 minute walk from there towards th water. Don’t forget you’ll need a 2-zone ticket when you get on.</p>

    <p>If you do drive, there is ample parking at the market and surrounding area.</p>

    <p><strong>What about accomodation?</strong><br />
    Our friends at the River Market are putting together a special price with a nearby hotel, so if you want to make a weekend of your trip you’ll be able to do so and save a few bucks at the same time.</p>

    <p><strong>Who is speaking?</strong><br />
    As an unconference, all are welcome to pitch a session to speak in and the audience will vote to show how much interest there is. We don’t hold timeslots ahead of the day, but in similar events we’ve rarely seen someone who shows up and wants to speak miss out on a chance.</p>

    <p><strong>What kinds of topics?</strong><br />
    We’re focussing on digital tools for creating and conveying stories. If you’re looking for a place to do a reading of your short story from an ipad, this isn’t the place. If in doubt, get in touch and let us know what you’re thinking. Chances are there’s someone else who would love to talk about the same thing.</p>

    <p><strong>What about the venue?</strong><br />
    Our title sponsor is the Network Hub, who have opened the doors of their amazing modern and open space right in the River Market building. The River Market staff are also providing support and were quick to point out the various smaller spaces throughout that can accomodate breakout groups and other ad-hoc disucssions. We think the diversity and modern feel in an historic context will make the perfect environment for discovering and nurturing new ideas.</p>

    <p><strong>What about sponsors?</strong><br />
    We are still looking for a few sponsors at the $250-$500 level to help cover remaining costs. Sponsors will receive a place on the website, special multiple mentions on our Twitter account and at the event. Any leftover funds will be donated to the literacy organization Frontier College after the event, with all sponsors listed as contributors. No matter how many digital tools we’re fascinated by, there are those who have missed out on the basics and we don’t want to forget about them.</p>
